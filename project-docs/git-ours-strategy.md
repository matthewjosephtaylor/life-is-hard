# Configuring Git with the `ours` Strategy

When working on projects that involve binary files, such as `bun.lockb`, merge conflicts are common. To simplify the merge process and prevent these conflicts, you can configure Git to always use the `ours` merge strategy. This ensures that during a merge, Git automatically keeps your version of the file and discards the conflicting changes.

## Steps to Configure the `ours` Strategy

### 1. Add the Merge Strategy to `.gitattributes`
First, you need to define which files should use the `ours` strategy in a `.gitattributes` file.

Create or modify the `.gitattributes` file in your repository and add the following line for each file you want to handle this way:

```bash
bun.lockb merge=ours
```

This tells Git to apply the `ours` merge strategy whenever there is a conflict for `bun.lockb`.

### 2. Configure Git to Use the `ours` Driver
To configure Git to use the `ours` driver globally (or locally within a repository), run the following command:

```bash
git config --global merge.ours.driver true
```

This registers the `ours` driver in Git so it can be used during merges.

### 3. Handle Existing Merge Conflicts
If you are currently in the middle of resolving a merge conflict, you can manually resolve the conflict for the file by running:

```bash
git checkout --ours bun.lockb
```

Then, add the resolved file and commit the changes:

```bash
git add bun.lockb
git commit -m "Resolved conflict for bun.lockb using ours strategy"
```

### 4. Optional: Re-run Dependency Installation
If you're dealing with a lockfile like `bun.lockb`, it’s a good idea to regenerate it after resolving the conflict:

```bash
bun install
```

This ensures that the lockfile is consistent with your current dependencies.

## Benefits of Using the `ours` Strategy

- **Simplifies Merges**: Automatically resolves conflicts in specified files without manual intervention.
- **Prevents Binary Conflicts**: For files like `bun.lockb`, merging is often impractical. This approach avoids the complexity.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that your version of the file is always maintained during merges.

## Caution
This strategy works well for lockfiles and similar files, but you should ensure it doesn’t discard important changes. Use with caution and ensure that your workflow accounts for any dependencies or indirect updates that could be missed.

## Conclusion
By configuring the `ours` strategy in Git, you can reduce the headache of dealing with binary file merge conflicts. This approach simplifies your workflow while ensuring consistent dependency management.
